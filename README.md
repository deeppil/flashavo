# AVO Flashcards
AVO Flashcards is a flashcard generation site, to make learning easier for students, professionals, even teachers! The idea for AVO flashcards was created from the BitnBuild Hackathon. 

# Current FeaturesðŸ’¡
- Login/Register
- Generate Flashcards(you can select n number of flashcards to be generated, default is 3)
- Follow up feature(Where you can ask one follow up to each flashcard to broaden your understanding)

# Future FeaturesðŸš¨
The architecture of our project and the idea itself allows for us to expand this prototype into a working site that is helpful to students, some of the features we have in mind are:
- Group flashcards and save for later usage
- Share flashcards with friends
- Quiz creation and live quizes where users can compete against each other

# Must Read
Please note, as this is a prototype the login and register features are done locally, hence accounts you create on one device will not work from another. This can be easily fixed once we integreate a database.
When first trying to generate flashcards it may take some extra time, as we are using a backend service which freezes after inactivity. The subsequent generation will be faster.

Created with passion,
Team AVO
